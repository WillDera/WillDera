# I'm Godswill 👋👨‍💻



I'm an enthusiastic data scientist and software developer. An avid learner who is passionate about Artificial intelligence and all its riches.
Most of the time, I focus my data science energy on the Deep Learning part while in other occasions you find me tinkering with Machine Learning models.
Some of the technologies I enjoy using as a Software developer are ReactJs, GatsbyJs and Django
